# Webflow App Generator Database Evaluation

This repository contains the evaluation and benchmarking of modern database solutions for Webflow's App Generator, focusing on scalability, developer experience, cost-effectiveness, and AI interoperability.

## Project Overview

The evaluation covers three modern database solutions:
1. Neon (Serverless Postgres)
2. Supabase (PostgreSQL)
3. MongoDB Atlas

Each solution is evaluated based on:
- Scalability (horizontal scaling, multi-region support)
- Developer Experience (SDKs, ORM support, migration tools)
- Cost Structure (pricing tiers, free options)
- Performance (read/write speed, latency)
- Reliability & Features (backups, failovers, edge deployments)
- AI Interoperability (schema generation, query assistance)

## Challenge Implementation Mapping

### Step 1: Database Research & Evaluation
- **Database Selection**: Evaluated three solutions (Neon, Supabase, MongoDB Atlas)
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Implemented in `docs/REPORT.md`
  - Scalability: Covered in Benchmarking Suite's Scaling Tests
  - Developer Experience: Documented in REPORT.md's Implementation Strategy
  - Cost Structure: Detailed in REPORT.md's Cost Analysis
  - Performance: Measured in Benchmarking Suite
  - Reliability & Features: Evaluated in REPORT.md's Evaluated Solutions section

### Step 2: AI Interoperability & LLM Codegen
- **Schema Auto-Generation**: Implemented in `scripts/schema-generator.ts`
  - Natural language to schema conversion
  - Relationship inference
  - Index optimization
- **Query Assistance**: Partially implemented in AI Integration section
  - Query generation
  - Optimization suggestions
  - Debugging assistance
- **Codegen**: Basic implementation in AI Integration section
  - API endpoint generation
  - TypeScript types
  - Migration scripts

### Step 3: Benchmarking & Hands-on Testing
- **Database Selection**: Selected two most promising databases (Neon and MongoDB Atlas) for benchmarking
- **Implementation**: Using Node.js scripts for testing (located in `scripts/benchmark.ts`)

#### Write Test
- Insert 10,000 rows of sample data
- Measures:
  - Write speed (rows per second)
  - Latency (time per insert)
  - Success rate
  - Error handling

#### Read Test
- Query dataset with:
  - Filtering (by user_id, date)
  - Sorting (by creation date)
  - Full-text search (on post titles)
- Measures:
  - Query execution time
  - Response latency
  - Result accuracy

#### Cold Start Latency
- Specifically tests Neon's serverless capabilities
- Measures:
  - Initial connection time
  - Query execution after cold start
  - Connection pooling effectiveness

#### Scaling Test (Optional)
- Evaluates concurrent request handling
- Tests:
  - Multiple simultaneous connections
  - Connection limits
  - Resource utilization under load

### Step 4: Summary & Recommendation
- **Technical Report**: Comprehensive findings in `docs/REPORT.md`
  - Executive summary
  - Detailed evaluation of all three solutions
  - Benchmark results for two selected databases
  - Cost analysis
  - Implementation recommendations
  - Next steps
