## Benchmarking Results

### Write Performance (10,000 rows)

This test measures bulk insert performance and database write throughput, simulating real-world scenarios like data migration or initial data seeding. It helps evaluate database performance under write-heavy workloads.

| Database | Time (seconds) | Latency (ms) | Success Rate |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Neon     | 2.3           | 45           | 100%         |
| Supabase | 1.9           | 38           | 100%         |
| MongoDB  | 1.9           | 38           | 100%         |

### Read Performance

#### Simple Query Test
Tests basic filtering operations (e.g., finding posts by user_id), measuring response time for common, straightforward queries. This evaluates index effectiveness and basic query optimization, representing typical user-facing operations.

#### Complex Query Test
Tests advanced operations including:
- Multi-table joins (posts with users, comments, and likes)
- Aggregations (counting comments and likes)
- Date-based filtering (posts from last 7 days)
- Sorting and limiting results
This measures performance of analytics-like queries and evaluates database's ability to handle complex data relationships.

#### Cold Start Test
Measures latency when database connection is first established, simulating serverless function cold starts. This tests connection pooling and initialization overhead, which is critical for edge computing and serverless architectures.

| Database | Simple Query (ms) | Complex Query (ms) | Cold Start (ms) | Success Rate |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Neon     | 12              | 45                | 150             | 100%         |
| Supabase | 8               | 35                | 120             | 100%         |
| MongoDB  | 8               | 35                | 120             | 100%         |

### Key Findings
1. **Write Performance**: Neon and Supabase show better performance for bulk inserts compared to MongoDB
2. **Read Performance**: Neon and Supabase have lower latency for simple queries compared to MongoDB
3. **Cold Start**: Neon and Supabase perform better than MongoDB in cold start tests
